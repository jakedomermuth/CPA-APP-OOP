# CPA-APP-OOP

## This project was built using object oriented design principles
You will build a client/tax return system for a small accounting firm. Your customer (the accounting firm)
requires the following from your application: <br>
• You must store the following information: <br>
o Information about CPAs (Certified Public Accountants). Each CPA will have multiple
clients. <br>
o Information about clients, including name, address, income, and if they have provided
tax materials to the firm. Each client will have only one CPA. <br>
o Information about the tax return, including the status (is it filed or not), timestamp of
filing (if it was filed), and if it has been checked by a CPA (‘yes’ automatically if the CPA
has filed it, ‘no’ if it was filed by the assistant). Each client can only have one tax return. <br>
• Your interface must have the following functions (they can be merged into less/nested options if
you want): <br>
o Add clients <br>
o Add tax filing assistants <br>
o Add CPAs <br>
o Mark if a client has provided their required materials <br>
o Check if client has provided their required materials <br>
o Mark if tax return is filed <br>
o Check if a return for a client is filed <br>
o Mark if a CPA checked a return <br>
o Check if a CPA checked a return <br>
